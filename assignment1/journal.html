      <h2>Syllabus Overview</h2>
      <p>
          Welcome to week one!<br>
          It's been a good week of review. The syllabus gave me a good idea of what to expect in
          our class WDD 330. It will include exercises and readings to help solve issues by making 
          web applications that also run on mobile devices.
          I double cheked that I have taken a prerequisite. Check! Many sources will be provided in 
          this course that will help with completing and understanding exercises and projects.
          Each week there will be reading and excercises to work though to help understanding.
          There will be challenges in which I am able to apply my knowledge to solve issues.
          Due dates are Wednesdays and Saturdays.</p>

      <h2>Doing Stuff with Web Things section 2.3 local storage</h2>    
         <p> In the reading I had a good refresher on what local storage is. It is what is stored on 
          computer while using a single website. Such as possibly something you would search and edit 
          save for later, or display in another place. This is what the exercise thought us as we 
          created a simple site that allowed the user to write a story, save it, access it later, 
          and then display it at the bottom of the page. It was also a good refresher on how to 
          get an element by id, how to store into and then call from local storage, and how to run 
          simple functions. You can find the code here: <a href="index.html">Local Storage</a></p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
      <h2>Portfolio Prep</h2>    
         <p> We also set up the portfolio for the semester, which proved to be tricker than I anticipated. 
          I needed a good refresher on how to call an id into javascript, and then add elements in 
          javascript. After figuring that out I was able to create and place within elements my info. 
          Then as I put those new elements inside the exsisting elements it was a trick to make sure that 
          was all in order correctly. Then I went ahead and did a little refresher on CSS so I could add 
          some style and keep things organized. Not to mention, remember how to center things in block display.</p>

    <h2>Master Mobile UX Video</h2>
         
            <h3>Intro:</h3> 
            <p>Design for the smallest and least powerful device first! Things are changing so fast that we
            have to program for lots of different kinds of devices. 2007 introduced a new era for mobile 
            devices. Different screens sizes with different resolutions. We have to keep this in mind so we
            can provide for all of these! Replacements of these devices are also being replaced every 1-4 years.
            Instead of having a single device for a family, now individuals have multiple devices. Retro-fitting 
            for mobile might save time but it can cause issues with size, bandwidth, etc. Start with mobile first.
            This might be time consuming and costly, but it is much more effective long term.
            Think of how many people you see walking around with their heads in their phones? This is the new
            paradigm shift. How many people do you see walking around with their laptops? This is not a fad!<br></p>
           
           
            <h3>Users:</h3>
            <p> People don't know what they want until you show it to them!</p><br>
            <p> <strong>1. Be there:</strong> <br>
           They expect you to be there and help them through questions.</p>
           <p> <strong>2. Be Useful:</strong> <br>
            Only 9% of users stay if they aren't satisfied with help of there needs. They have to receive what 
          they came for as quickly as possible or they will leave. Provide them with what they came for as quickly
        as possible when they arrive.</p>
            <p> <strong>3. Be Quick:</strong> <br>
             Reduce their cognitive load! Not just fast loading but serious functionality as well. Smooth and seamless
            interaction. If it takes 5 steps... it's too much! Make it 0 steps for them. Have it do something in background. 
            Think of how they are holding the device. Using a one handed grip with a thumb to reach things. The larger the
            device, the more you have to decide on UI/UX to create functionality.
            Loading is a big deal too! 1/2 second delay could mean 20% drop in traffic. 2 seconds could cost 4% drop in revenue!
            The faster it loads the more likely they are to stay and use your app longer. Networks are crucial! Not everyone
          has the latest and greatest! So make sure you are creating the fastest speeds.</p>
          <p><strong>Speed</strong>
          1. reduce image usage! small images for small devices and shorter loading times and resolution when needed. <br>
          2. SVG/Webfonts are lower in bandwidth<br>
          3. Optimize and Miniamize CSS and JS files.
          4. GZIP files to eliminate unneccesary data usuage</p><br>

          <h3>Primary Controls:</h3>
          <p>Be empathic to users needs! Menu/Primary controls should be where it's easily accessed! Menu and Subnavigation also 
            at the bottom of the screen for mobile users with there single and hold and reachablity with thumb.
            It makes the app seem faster which increases the use of the app and the user satisfaction. Hamburger menu still
            not known 100% as the menu button. Create a "button" or a wrapped word to draw the users to the area. Just the word
            menu wrapped in a border has the highest success rate.<br>
          </p>
          <h3>Mobile Inputs:Forms</h3>
          <p>Make more focused simplied solutions. There is less screen, so we need to reduce that cognitive load!
            Make sure when you make forms that you only ask for information that is required! Put the labels inside
            the type field so that you can use less space. Try to avoid confusion by disapearing words. Let them appear
            above while in use. Make check boxes large for phone/thumb. Make what they want appear simple and quickly.
            Break it into quick simple sections with an obvious end point. Allow Auto complete. Allow a hide or show
            password button. Default show. It doesn't decrease security. Space credit card numbers to create clarity.
            If you are needing a number imput, make sure you use the number pad! Make phone numbers anchors to they
            can quickly tap and call without having to type it in.<br>
          </p>
          <h3>Mobile Advertising:</h3>
          <p>Do your research! How do users use their devices! NO POP UPS!!!!!!
            If adding ads, make them small and simple. Make it revealable, but keep it small. Cool! you can put a window
             behind the article that has the add sticky to the page so you scroll up the add while you scroll through the
            article. Keep it simple!!!
