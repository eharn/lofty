      <h2>Ch 2: Programming Baiscs</h2>
      <h3>Comments:</h3>
      <p>Single line comments start with // and finish at the end of the line of code:<br>
        // this is a short comment <br><br>
        Multiline comments start with /* and end with */: <br>
        /* This is a longer comment <br>
        but anything on the lines between <br>
        the comments will be ignored. <br>
        */<br>
        <br>
      </p>
        <h3>Grammar:</h3>
        <p>
          ASI: Automatic Semicolon Insertion<br>
          This means that each line of code with assume that it has a ; at the end. <br>
          However, some validators and such won't work without all the appropriate semicolons.<br>
          <strong>Best Practice is to end each statement with a semi-colon and start a new line.</strong><br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Reserved Words:</h3>
          <p>This list of words can not be used for variable names, function parameters, object properties etc:<br>
          These words are reserved for use JS language:<br>
          abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, 
          default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, 
          function, goto, if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, 
          package, private, protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, 
          throws, transient, true, try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, and yield<br>
          <strong>Best Practice is to also not use undefined, NaN, and Infinity.</strong><br><br>
        </p>

          <h3>Primitive Data Types:</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScipt has 7 data types:<br>
          Six are Primaitve Data Types: String, Symbol, Number, Boolean, Undefined, and Null <br>
          If any value isn't one of these it will be an <strong>object</strong><br>
          To figure out the type of a value you can use <strong>typeof</strong> and it will return the type of data type.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Declaring and Assigning:</h3>
        <p>From ES6 onward, JavaScipt uses <strong>const</strong> and <strong>let</strong> to declare variables. These are blocked scoped, meaning their value only exists insid eth block they are declared in.<br>
          <strong>const</strong> is used to assign a variable that will not be reassigned any other value.<br>
          <strong>let</strong> is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.<br>
          <strong>var is no longer Best Practice.</strong>
          You can also assign multiple values at once using commas. Ex: let x=3, y=4, z=5;<br>
          <strong>If a variable references an object using const doesn't make it unchangable. The data in an object can change/mutate.</strong><br><br>
          Ex:<br>const name = { value: 'Alexa' }; // an object <br>
          name.value = 'Siri'; // change the value<br>
          << 'Siri'<br><br>

          However, using const on an object means you can't reassign a variable to another object.<br><br>
          Ex: // declare object  <br>
          const name = { value: 'Alexa' };<br>
          // attempt to reassign to another object<br>
          name = { value: 'Siri' }<br>
          << TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>Other Must knows:</h3>
        <p>Constant and varaible names can start with an upper or lower-case letter, an underscore, or dollar character. You can also use letters but can't start with a number. <br>
        Avoid starting with an underscore and using the $ character for other programs and frameworks use them.<br>
        Be consistent! <strong>Using Camel case is Best Practice.</strong> Start with lowercase letter and then uppercase at the start of every new word. Also use underscoreds to separate each new word.<br>
        </p><br><br>
        <p>
          <strong>Backslashes: must be used to escape special character in strings.</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>sing quote marks: \'</li>
            <li>double quote marks: \"</li>
            <li>end of line: \n</li>
            <li>carriage return: \r</li>
            <li>tab: \t</li>
            <li>backslash: \\</li>
          </ul>
        </p><br><br>
        
          <h4>Dot Notation:</h4>
          <p>
            Access properties of a string by writing a dot followed by the property we are interested in. Such as the length property.<br>
            variable.length returns the length of the string.
        </p><br><br>
        <p>
          Don't forget about methods! You can use dot notation to use them and they end in (). This allows you to manipulate a string and gain
          info about them. If the thing you are looking for returns a -1 then they don't appear in the string. Method includes() returns 
          ture or false if character you're looking for is included in the sting or not.
        </p><br><br>

        <p>
          The concat() method can concatenate two or more strings together.Ex: 'JavaScript'.concat('Ninja'); returns 'JavaScriptNinja'<br>
          Or the short hand is to use + between strings. Ex: 'Java' + 'Script' + '' + 'Ninja'; returns 'JavaScript Ninja'
        </p><br><br>

        <h4>Template Literals:</h4>
        <p>template literals are a special string using  the backtick character `` which makes it possible to use both sets of quote in the string '' and "",br>
          They also allow interpolation of JavaScipt code. Meaning a JavaScipt expression can be inserted inside a string and the result will be displayed:<br>
        Ex: <br>
        const name = `Siri`;<br>
        `Hello ${ name }!`; <br>
          << 'Hello Siri!'<br><br>

          const age = 39;<br>
        `I will be ${ age + 1 } next year`;<br>
          << 'I will be 40 next year'<br>
        <br>
        The JavaScript is place inside the curly braces with a $ character infront of them. You can include line breaks with \n in a string.
